Hello fellow Primates!

In this challenge you will be reading in JSON values via AJAX and reflecting their values on the screen.
Useful links

jQuery Ajax documentation is here.
Assignment!!!

Using the things we've learned about $.ajax(), pull in the JSON list of color names and values. Iterate over our list, creating a new div for each entry. You will append a p tag into each div with the name of the color, and add a CSS class with the color value to the entire div.
Hard Mode

Use Handlebars instead of appending DOM elements.
Pro Mode

Store your Handlebars template in a separate HTML file, and pull that in using a second Ajax function.
