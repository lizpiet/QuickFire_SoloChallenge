#Challenge

For this challenge, you are going to be building the team randomizer that I use in class! Do a new project setup, bring in jQuery for this one (no Bootstrap this time). Send backdown a HTML file that pulls in jQuery as well. The data to support the app should be a JSON file that exists on the server. 

The client, once loaded, should request that data, store it locally and be ready to use by the app. Once that is done, load 10 numeric buttons onto the DOM. They should have the numbers 2 - 11 on them. Additionally, you should have a randomize button. 

To start that experience, click on one of the numeric buttons, which should lock in the number of teams to create. The randomize button, should then shuffle the people in data that came back from the server and then display them onto the DOM. Each time the randomize button is clicked, it should reshuffle the teams (note, you may need to Google how to shuffle an array). 

##Hard Mode
Animate them onto the DOM as I have it done in class (link coming soon).

##Pro Mode
Build an entirely new set of buttons that represents the number of people who should be in each team (rather than the number of teams). Set up new functionality accordingly.
